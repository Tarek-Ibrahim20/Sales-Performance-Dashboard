# Sales-Performance-Dashboard
## Project Description
In this Power BI project, the primary focus was on transforming raw data into actionable insights through a series of structured steps. 
The project workflow can be summarized as follows:

### Data Cleaning with Power Query:
The initial step involved cleaning the incoming data to ensure its quality and readiness for subsequent analysis. Leveraging Power Query, every piece of data underwent a thorough cleaning process, guaranteeing its suitability for the desired analyses and visualizations.
Data Modeling:
Following data cleaning, a robust data model was created to establish relationships across various tables. Additionally, a dedicated calendar table was crafted to harness the capabilities of time intelligence functions, facilitating in-depth temporal analyses.

### Visualizations for Insights:
With a solid data foundation in place, the project transitioned to building visually appealing and informative dashboards. These visuals were designed to address specific questions and extract valuable insights from the refined dataset.
### Key Insights Addressed:
#### Determining the total revenue for a specified year along with its percentage contribution to the overall revenue.
#### Analyzing the distribution of revenue across different months.
#### Exploring the relationship between total revenue, quantity sold in each category, and their interplay.
#### Identifying the top and bottom revenue-generating countries.
#### Visualizing the monthly revenue fluctuations and their percentage changes.
#### Evaluating if the time gap between order and shipping dates influences revenue estimation.
